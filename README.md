# PeterSQL

> Heidi's (silly?) friend - a wxPython porting of HeidiSQL

**PeterSQL** is a graphical client for database management, inspired by the excellent [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/), but written entirely in **Python** with **wxPython**, and designed to run natively on **All OS**.

---

## ðŸ§­ Why PeterSQL?

Over the years, I have used **HeidiSQL** as my primary tool for working with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and other databases. It is a tool that I greatly appreciate: **streamlined**, **intuitive**, **powerful**.

So, as a personal challenge, I decided to port it to Python.

- âœ… An interface similar to HeidiSQL
- âœ… A *simple* and *clean* DB client like HeidiSQL
- âœ… A free and open source project, extensible in Python

## ðŸ”§ Tecnologie utilizzate

- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)
- [wxPython 4.2.3](https://wxpython.org/) - native cross-platform interface
- [wxFormBuilder 4.2.1](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder) - for the construction of the interface
