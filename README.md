# PeterSQL

> Heidi's (silly?) friend - a wxPython porting of HeidiSQL

**PeterSQL** is a graphical client for database management, inspired by the
excellent [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/), but written entirely in **Python** with **wxPython**, and designed to
run natively on **All OS**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

PeterSQL is currently under active development.  
The project is **not finished** and should be considered **unstable**.

Features may be incomplete, change without notice, or break between versions.  
Use at your own risk and **do not rely on this project in production environments** yet.

## üß≠ Why PeterSQL?

Over the years, I have used **HeidiSQL** as my primary tool for working with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and other
databases. It is a tool that I greatly appreciate: **streamlined**, **intuitive**, **powerful**.

So, as a personal challenge, I decided to port it to Python.

- ‚úÖ An interface similar to HeidiSQL
- ‚úÖ A *simple* and *clean* DB client like HeidiSQL
- ‚úÖ A free and open source project, extensible in Python

## üîß Technologies used

- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)
- [wxPython 4.2.3](https://wxpython.org/) - native cross-platform interface
- [wxFormBuilder 4.2.1](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder) - for the construction of the interface
